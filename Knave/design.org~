* Attributes
  
** The 6 stats
   Keeping the 6 attributes is a great idea and the first time players will manage to recognise 
   easily the main traits of their characters when they will try their hands on a different game.

** Bonus and Score
   The bonus being rolled first and then the score computed second is a lovely idea and I want to
   keep it. Naming the score a save is still a bit of a missnomer, and I find it a bit confusing.
   
  
* Physical/Mental balance
  Using same the 6 attributes is a good ideas but changing the definition/use is 
  doomed to get first time players confused.
